# Simple-Automatic-Rigger
A simple tool for automatic FK rigging in Autodesk Maya, made in Python. This is mostly done to speed up my own work when placing the controls and adding constraints between these and the joints.

### How to Use
- Mark all the joints you wish to have FK
- Determine the scale of the nurb(s) if necessary, or just scale them by yourself after using this tool
- Decide if you want to group all the controls associated with, for example, an arm automatically with the tool or if you want to do it yourself.
- Done.
